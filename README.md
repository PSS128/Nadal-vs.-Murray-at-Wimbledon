How Nadal and Murray compare against each other at Wimbledon?

## Comparing Nadal's and Murray's performance at Wimbledon through statistics

- Both Nadal and Murray have 2 Wimbledons each (As of 2019), and despite having the same number of titles, there are differences in their overall performance at Wimbledon
- I used ggplot in R with publicly available tennis data to create multiple scatterplot models using the dominance ratio for Nadal and Murray in all of their Wimbldeon matchesm and the ranking of the opponents at Wimbleond that Nadal and Murray won/lost against 
- The dominance ratio is defined as (% of points won on opponent’s serve / % of points lost on own serve) measures the ease, or level of control a player has in their match 
- The ranking of the opponent measures the quality/level of the opponent.  
- I also chose to analyze both Murray and Nadal’s losses at Wimbledon along with their wins because understanding how they lost and what type of players they lost to gives a clearer assessment of their level.
