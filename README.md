# Nadal-vs.-Murray-at-Wimbledon
How Nadal and Murray compare against each other at Wimbledon?

## Comparing Nadal's and Murray's performance at Wimbledon through statistics

- Both Nadal and Murray have 2 Wimbledons each (As of 2019), and despite having the same number of titles, there are differences in their overall performance at Wimbledon
- I used ggplot in R with publicly available tennis data to create multiple scatterplot models using the dominance ratio for Nadal and Murray in all of their Wimbldeon matchesm and the ranking of the opponents at Wimbleond that Nadal and Murray won/lost against 
- The dominance ratio is defined as (% of points won on opponent’s serve / % of points lost on own serve) measures the ease, or level of control a player has in their match 
- The ranking of the opponent measures the quality/level of the opponent.  
- I also chose to analyze both Murray and Nadal’s losses at Wimbledon along with their wins because understanding how they lost and what type of players they lost to gives a clearer assessment of their level.
- I chose median rather than mean for both dominance ratio and ranking since using the mean is susceptible to extreme values

## Conclusion

- Looking at the players they won against, both Murray and Nadal basically dominated in their wins to the same degree and the players that they played against were quite similar too. 
- Nadal, over his career, tended to face lower ranked players at Wimbledon than Murray, but the difference isn't significant enough. 
- In Nadal's peak, from the years 2006-2011 (injured in 2009), Nadal exhibited an extremely high level of performance at Wimbledon, making 3 finals and winning 2 titles. 
- Murray, on the other hand, has never reached this level of dominance, but has a lot more consistent results than Nadal. 
- In Murray's peak, from 2008-2016, he won two titles, made a final, four semifinals and 1 quarterfinal
- Despite not being as dominant as Nadal in this time period, he was able to maintain his level for a longer period of time. <br />
 <br />

- Now looking at the players that Nadal and Murray lost against, we see that Nadal tended to lose to weaker players but typically in close matches, and that Murray tended to lose to stronger players in a more decisive manner. 
- From 2006-2011, in the 5 finals that Nadal made, he lost 3 of them to either the world #1 or #2 player. 
- And from the years 2012-2015, Nadal lost to players ranked outside the top 100. 
- From 2008-2016, Murray lost only once to a player outside of the top 6. <br />
<br />

- So who is better at Wimbledon then? It really depends on what you view to be the most important factors. If you view absolute level, or peak performance with more importance, then Nadal would be better at Wimbledon. And if you view consistency and reliability with more importance, then Murray would be better at Wimbledon.
